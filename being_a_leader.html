                <h1>Being a leader</h1>

                <h5>
                It is not easy to lead and far too many people underestimate the effort it takes to be a great leader. There is an old adage that says "action speaks louder than words". Leaders should not necessarily be the loudest guys out there but they need to be able to carry the team towards its goals. Below I discuss the most important things I believe leaders should address.
                Ability to give direction at the very beginning of any assignment
                It is crucial to be able to direct your team at the very start of any assignment. You should know about the objectives, problems to be solved and have a plan for action. You should talk to each member and tell them what is expected of them. By doing so, your team members will be mentally prepared and will know how much effort is expected from them. It is also more likely that they will take ownership and responsibility of their tasks. Productivity will increase as every team member will know exactly what the goal is for them. This will also help eliminate the need to work harder or do overtime when the deadline is close.
                </h5>

                <strong>Communication</strong>
                <p>By communicating I do not mean you should be the guy who talks the most. 
                    You should be able to pass on any important message, be it positive or negative to all team members in a diplomatic way. 
                    Good communication also means that you remain open to suggestions and concerns. 
                    You cannot become a great leader if you do not communicate well.
                </p>

                <strong>Integrity</strong>
                <p>If you have integrity, the team will trust you as they will feel that they are led in an appropriate way. 
                    If they can trust you, they will follow you. 
                    Integrity means to treat every team member the same way, and not put friendships or feelings into context. 
                    It is also important to balance the workload throughout the team ensuring that no team member has to do much more work than the rest.
                </p>

                <strong>Assigning tasks in a wise manner</strong>
                <p>
                You can use a SWOT analysis to identify the strengths and weaknesses of your team members. 
                If you misallocate tasks, this will create an unnecessary pressure within the team which can be very demotivating. 
                For e.g. in a team of software engineers, it will be wise to allocate front end development tasks to those who like doing it instead of forcing it upon those who are not interested. 
                This will make the whole team feel better. It will keep the load off the team because if someone is doing something he likes, he is more likely to put in more effort and get the job done almost without any assistance. 
                If someone takes over a task he/she is not interested in, he/she will more likely seek help for every problem faced instead of putting in the required effort to do the task autonomously.
                </p>

                <strong>Dealing with introverts and extroverts</strong>
                <p>
                Many people think that extroverts are superior team-players. 
                They are often perceived as being more competent team members as they seem to boost about every single thing they know or assume they know. 
                They usually ooze with confidence when they speak and are mostly over confident in things they do. 
                But as it turns out, extroverts sometimes do worse than they are expected, and may lose status as they disappoint others. 
                On the other hand introverts tend to undersell the expectations of their work. 
                This does not mean that introverts are always better but you have to be very careful with extroverts and analyse them instead of forming an opinion based solely on their behavior. 
                Neither is better nor worse but as a leader you should be able to work with these types of people and know the true worth of each person.
                </p>

                <strong>Reading people</strong>
                <p>
                You should be able to read people and be aware of your team members' unspoken feelings. 
                They should know that you are open to hear what they have to say. 
                Moreover, understanding your team members is crucial to ascertain which management style would be appropriate for them. 
                With some team members, a paternal leadership style is more suitable as they always need guidance and support. 
                While it is better to adopt a free-reign leadership style with some, leaving them to their own tasks.
                </p>

                <strong>Reviewing past decisions and listening to others</strong>
                <p>
                You should establish a processes for reviewing decisions made. 
                It is also very important to take time and analyze the performance of your team. 
                Errors need to be faced openly and used as a vehicle for learning and growth. 
                As such, team members will have the opportunity to develop new skills and experience.
                </p>

                <strong>Identifying trouble makers</strong>
                <p>
                You will come across people who have a habit of complaining about almost every situation or backbite their team mates. 
                You should know how to deal with these people, else they can become a poison to the proper functioning of the team. 
                At the end of the day, you just need them to deliver.
                </p>

                <strong>Setting the example</strong>
                <p>
                As a leader, you should behave in the same way as you want your team members to behave because they are very likely to mirror you.
                </p>

                <strong>Working overtime is a big sign of inefficiency</strong>
                <p>
                You should be aware that working overtime is not a sign of hard work or commitment but rather a sign of bad planning and inefficiency. 
                It is a collective failure and you are at the helm of it all. 
                You should make sure that the work is completed within the specified time frame. 
                That is why before starting any project you should ensure that the time frame is within the capacity of the team. 
                You need to raise the tempo early on if the pace at which the team is going is too slow.
                </p>

                <strong>Financial Rewards</strong>
                <p>
                Last but not least you should ensure that your team members get the salary they deserve and that they are rewarded for additional efforts. 
                Performance benefits can also be a motivating factor for some.
